# LightningCash
===========================================

What is LightningCash ?
----------------------

Lightning Cash is a coin based on Yespower POW algorithm, including DarkGravityWave ( difficulty changes for every block ) and possible CURRENT block difficulty change over time to protect against high network hash variation and long stale tip. For full details, please visit our website at https://lightningcash.tk . Compiled binary releases are available on Github.

LightningCash Core is the full node software that makes up the backbone of the LTNC network.

Characteristics
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


- Hash Algorithm : YespowerLTNCG POW algorithm    ( CPU only ) ( same algorithm as LightningCash-Gold so the same CPU miners can be used ! )

( With the addition of modified Dash's DarkGravityWave v3 algorithm, that changes difficulty every block, and progressively lowers difficulty if long stale tips happens. Tested and fully working !!)

- The Hive : A " hodl and profit " mining system accessible to everyone, that works side by side with POW mining, invented by  LitecoinCash's developers !!

- Total Supply : 210,000,000 LTNC

- Difficulty adjusted every block and possibly in CURRENT block if a long network stale tip happens !! This protects LightningCash from high hash variations and " high hash attacks " , that happens frequently for new coins and kills them by making the mining difficulty too high for the " normal " network's hash rate. 

- Changed famous NOMP ( node open mining portal ) pool software to include possible CURRENT block difficulty change and send new work to miners if so.

- 5 seconds block time.

- Number of confirmations needed for a transaction : 6  (transaction is confirmed in approximately 30 seconds)

- Premine : 2,200,000 coins, barely above 1 % of max supply

- Block Reward : 5 LightningCash - halved every 8 400 000 blocks

- Synchronising the wallet takes about 2 hours with a normal download speed.



LightningCash is based on LightningCash-Gold, LitecoinCash Core, Litecoin Core and Bitcoin Core's open source codes.
LightningCash is an independant coin and is not associated in any way with LitecoinCash or LightningCash-Gold.
